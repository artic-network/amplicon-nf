You're giving an overview to someone new\n   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction\n-->\n\n\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core\n     workflows use the \"tube map\" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/graphic_design/workflow_diagrams#examples for examples.   -->\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nFirst, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:\n\n`samplesheet.csv`:\n\n```csv\nsample,platform,scheme_name,custom_scheme_path,custom_scheme_name,fastq_directory,fastq_1,fastq_2\nnanopore_amplicon_data,nanopore,artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0,,,/path/to/fastq/files/Barcode01/,,,\nillumina_amplicon_data,illumina,,/path/to/custom_scheme/,some_scheme_name,,/path/to/fastq/files/AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,/path/to/fastq/files/AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz\n```\n\nEach row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end), the pipeline will run the Illumina and ONT workflows in parallel, it is important to note that the ONT and Illumina workflows have different input requirements. ONT requires only `fastq_directory` which is intended to be a directory as created by Dorado / minKNOW during basecalling. Below there is an example layout of a `fastq_pass` directory, each row of the samplesheet in this case would point to a single `barcode` directory.\n\n```\nfastq_pass\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 barcode01\n   |   \u251c\u2500\u2500 reads0.fastq.gz\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 reads1.fastq.gz\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 barcode02\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 reads0.fastq.gz\n   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 reads1.fastq.gz\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 reads2.fastq.gz\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 barcode03\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 reads0.fastq.gz\n```\n\nFor example, if your `fastq_pass` directory looked the same as the above example your samplesheet could look like this:\n\n```csv\nsample,platform,scheme_name,fastq_directory\nbarcode01,nanopore,artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0,/some/directory/fastq_pass/barcode01\nbarcode02,nanopore,artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0,/some/directory/fastq_pass/barcode02\nbarcode03,nanopore,artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0,/some/directory/fastq_pass/barcode03\n```\n\nPlease note that for a single platform run (as in, your data is all ONT rather than a mix of ONT and Illumina) you do not need to include irrelevant columns, the same is true for the custom scheme fields (`custom_scheme_path` and `custom_scheme_name`).\n\nFor Illumina data the paths to the forward and reverse read files should be provided directly, for example if your directory looks like the below:\n```\nrun_fastq_directory\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sample-1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\n   |\u2500\u2500 sample-1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sample-2_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 sample-2_S2_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz\n```\n\nThen your samplesheet could look like this:\n\n```csv\nsample,platform,scheme_name,fastq_1,fastq_2\nsample-1,illumina,artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0,/some/directory/sample-1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz,/some/directory/sample-1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz\nsample-2,illumina,artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0,/some/directory/sample-2_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz,/some/directory/sample-2_S2_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz\n```\n\nAs the ONT only samplesheet above does not need the `fastq_1` or `fastq_2` path columns the Illumina only samplesheet does not need the `fastq_directory` column.\n\nWe recommend that you provide a scheme using a [primalscheme labs](https://labs.primalscheme.com/) identifier e.g. `artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0` or `artic-sars-cov-2/400/v5.4.2` which is laid out with the following schema `<SCHEME_NAME>/<SCHEME_LENGTH>/<SCHEME_VERSION>`, the scheme itself will be sourced from the [primerschemes repository](https://github.com/quick-lab/primerschemes).\n\nAlternatively, if you wish to use a scheme not available from the official repository you may provide a samplesheet containing the `custom_scheme_path` and `custom_scheme_name` parameters, `custom_scheme_path` should point to a directory containing two files `primer.bed` and `reference.fasta` which describe your custom scheme, `custom_scheme_name` is an optional field which allows you to provide a name for this custom scheme which will be used when generating a run report, if this is provided with a `scheme_name` the `custom_scheme_name` will be ignored. \n\nNow, you can run the pipeline using:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run artic-network/amplicon-nf \\\n   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR> \\\n   --storedir <STOREDIR> \n```\n\nThe pipeline is configured with a set of default parameters which should suit most use cases but a full list of available configurable parameters is available in [docs/parameters.md](https://github.com/artic-network/amplicon-nf/blob/main/docs/parameters.md).\n\nIf you are running this pipeline locally (for example on a sequencing laptop) you may wish to put a limit on the amount of resources that the pipeline will attempt to use, to do this there are two profiles which limit the amount of resources the pipeline will try to use to fit on more modest hardware, if you wish to use one of these profiles you may do so like this:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run artic-network/amplicon-nf \\\n   -profile low_resource,<docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR> \\\n   --storedir <STOREDIR> \n```\n\nThe `-profile` parameter accepts multiple profiles separated by a comma so providing a parameter such as `-profile low_resource,docker` will use both profiles at the same time.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\n## Problems and Solutions\n\nIf you provide ONT data which does not have the `basecall_model_version_id` field in the read header (ONT basecallers include this info in the header) you will get an error message that looks like this:\n\n```sh\n  Provided fastq does not contain basecall_model_version_id in the read header so clair3 model cannot be chosen automatically, please provide an appropriate model with the --model parameter\n```\n\nIf you do see this, you will need to provide the Clair3 model name manually with the `--manual_clair3_model` parameter, a full list of the available models is available in the [parameters.md document](docs/parameters.md).\n\n## Credits\n\nartic-network/amplicon-nf was originally written by Sam Wilkinson.\n\nWe thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline:\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: If applicable, make list of people who have also contributed -->\n\n## Contributions and Support\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please see the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Citations\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add citation for pipeline after first release.
